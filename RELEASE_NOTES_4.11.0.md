# CodeArt v4.11.0 - Chat UI Revolution 🎨

## What's New

We've completely redesigned the chat interface to provide a more modern, flexible, and user-friendly experience. This release focuses on making it easier to switch between different modes and experiment with various AI models.

## 🌟 Highlights

### Interactive Mode Selector

No more guessing what each mode does! The new button-based mode selector shows you exactly what each mode is capable of:

- **Agent Mode** 🎯 - Full editing power with workspace modifications
- **Ask Mode** ❓ - Read-only exploration for learning and understanding
- **Plan Mode** 📋 - Strategic planning without making changes

Simply hover over any mode to see detailed tooltips explaining its capabilities.

### Per-Turn Model Selection

Choose the perfect AI model for each specific task without changing your global settings:

- **60+ Models Available** from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and xAI
- **Smart Organization** - Models grouped by provider for easy browsing
- **One-Time Use** - Model selection resets after each message
- **No Permanent Changes** - Your default model stays unchanged

## 🚀 Perfect For

### Developers Who Want to:

- **Compare models** side-by-side for different coding tasks
- **Use specialized models** for specific problems (reasoning, creativity, speed)
- **Understand mode capabilities** before switching
- **Experiment freely** without affecting their workflow settings

### Common Workflows:

1. **Code Review**: Use Ask mode with Claude Sonnet 4 for detailed analysis
2. **Quick Questions**: Stay in Agent mode with GPT-4o Mini for fast responses
3. **Complex Problems**: Switch to Plan mode with DeepSeek Reasoner for step-by-step solutions
4. **Creative Tasks**: Try different models to see which works best for your style

2. Hover over any button to see what it does

2. Browse models organized by provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
3. Select any model you want to try

5. The selector automatically resets to your default for the next message
